This theme implements a built-in Jekyll feature, the use of Pygments, for sytanx highlighting. It supports more than 100 languages. This example is in C++. All you have to do is wrap your code in a liquid tag: 
{% raw  %}
{% highlight c++ %}  <br/> code code code <br/> {% endhighlight %}{% endraw %}

Produces something like this: 

{% highlight python %}

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}
